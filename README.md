Phase 1 of this project includes a basic site made up of multiple html files and a few css files. this contains basic information with a simple setup.

Phase 2 of this project is the completed version
it has the ability to read and write from databases
it can automatically process and change the website according to what is added to the database.

when making phase two i used the free version of mamp on my macbook however for windows you may need xamp.
everything is locally hosted you may need to change the password and username of the database and the table names if you would like to use my project as a template.

Phase 2 as it is now interacts with a database and automatically updates itself allowing you to write new blogs as you wish. Also your login information is checked against the database.
You can preview blogs before you upload them and there are javascript features to clear forms and automatically check that fields arent empty.

Phase 2 is mostly done with the use of php and converting many html files into php files.
There is also javascript however none of it is embedded it is all located in other files and called from the php.
